            <h2 style="font-size: 1cm; font-family: verdana; color:#F1C40F">WHO ARE THE PLANETEERS.</h2>
            <p style="font-family: verdana;">In Spring 2017, a number of students from the New York City College of Technology in Downtown Brooklyn 
            had begun to notice that little was being done to encourage recycling or promote sustainable living 
            on our campus. Insufficient recycling bins, the Co-mingling of trash, unmaintained green spaces, and
            the lack of knowledge and concern about environmental issues by a vast majority of students were the 
            main problems that motivated us to seek change. The shared passion for environmental justice made the
            students assemble into a green task force which is now formally known as the <b>PLANETEERS</b>.</p>
            <p style="font-family: verdana;">By working together, we believe we can support the environment by helping raise awareness, providing 
            tools for change and motivation, and by actively participating in projects that have an immediate 
            impact on the environment such as collecting recyclable items, gardening. 
            The club meets once a month to discuss projects, events, and issues concerning the environment that 
            affects us on a local, national, and global level. We are constantly working towards developing solutions 
            to problems we are facing on campus and in the community.</p>
        <br>
            <h2 style="font-size:1cm; color:#F1C40F">WHAT WE DO</h2>
            <p>The City Tech Planeteers are a green task force whose mission is to raise awareness about the effects of 
            pollution and Climate Change and to encourage recycling, energy and water conservation. We believe 
            the key to saving our planet is through sustainable living.</p>
