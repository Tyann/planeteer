                    <h2>How climate change is affecting the Earth.</h2>
                    <p>In the past three years, this magazine has run 34 stories 
                        on climate change—including a special issue devoted entirely
                        to the topic
                    </p> 
                    <p> Our commitment is ongoing. In the April issue, to mark Earth 
                        Day, we’ll publish a guide that separates fact from fallacy on 
                        climate change and a feature story on how rising temperatures 
                        are affecting Alaska. Later this year we’ll offer looks at 
                        the Arctic, Antarctica, the Galápagos Islands, and other places 
                        at risk as the world warms. Our television channel is airing 
                        a documentary film and a three-part series on water issues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And that doesn’t count the hundreds of climate stories 
                        we have published on nationalgeographic.com
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Covering our climate—where we keep setting records for 
                        the hottest year—is one of the most important things 
                        we can do. It’s especially crucial in an era when some 
                        people claim that there are no “facts” and basic 
                        science is loudly questioned without embarrassment.

                    <h2>Amazon deforestation</h2>
                    <p>The Amazon is the world’s largest rainforest and the largest
                       river basin on the planet. More species are found here than anywhere else.
                    </p>

                    <p>The region is believed to be home to 10% – 1 in 10 – known species 
                        on Earth. Of plant species found in this region, 75% are unique 
                        to the Amazon, and there are 3,000 species of fish, the largest 
                        number of freshwater fish species in the world.
                    </p>

                    <p>Today, the Amazon is facing a multitude of threats as a result of 
                        unsustainable economic development; 20% of the Amazon biome has 
                        already been lost and the trend will worsen if gone unchecked.
                    </p>

                    <p>Amazon is the biggest deforestation front in the world and 
                        interventions are urgently needed to prevent a large-scale, 
                        irreversible ecological disaster.
                    </p>

                    <p>WWF estimates that 27 per cent – more than a quarter – of the 
                        Amazon biome will be without trees by 2030 if the current rate 
                        of deforestation continues.

                    <h2>Climate change is increasing flood risks in Europe</h2>
                    <p>As humans continue to emit greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, the world 
                        continues to warm. We see that warming everywhere – in the atmosphere, in 
                        the oceans, with rising sea levels, and melting ice. But while we know 
                        conclusively that humans are causing the warming, an equally important 
                        question is, “so what?” Really, we want to know the consequences of warming 
                        so that we can make informed decisions about what to do about it. We really 
                        have only three choices: mitigate, adapt, or ignore and suffer the consequences.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A very new study was just published that helps answer this question of “so what?” 
                        The research was conducted by lead author Lorenzo Alfieri (European 
                        Commission – Joint Research Centre, Italy), Richard Betts (University of Exeter 
                        and Met Office, UK), and their colleagues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the study, the authors used what are called Impact Models to assess the 
                        risks of large-scale flooding. They focused their attention on Europe partly 
                        because there is a lot of hydrological information there, flood reporting is
                        easily available, and predictions of future climate there are plentiful. The 
                        authors compared estimates of flood risk in Europe from three recent case 
                        studies; their comparison incorporated changes to future climate, expected 
                        damage, and population that will be affected in the flooding zones.

                    <h2>Choking the Oceans With Plastic</h2>
                    <p>
                        LOS ANGELES — The world is awash in plastic. It’s in our cars and our carpets, 
                        we wrap it around the food we eat and virtually every other product we consume; 
                        it has become a key lubricant of globalization — but it’s choking our future in 
                        ways that most of us are barely aware.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have just returned with a team of scientists from six weeks at sea conducting 
                        research in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch — one of five major garbage patches 
                        drifting in the oceans north and south of the Equator at the latitude of our 
                        great terrestrial deserts. Although it was my 10th voyage to the area, I was 
                        utterly shocked to see the enormous increase in the quantity of plastic waste 
                        since my last trip in 2009. Plastics of every description, from toothbrushes 
                        to tires to unidentifiable fragments too numerous to count floated past our 
                        marine research vessel Alguita for hundreds of miles without end. We even 
                        came upon a floating island bolstered by dozens of plastic buoys used in oyster 
                        aquaculture that had solid areas you could walk on.
                    </p>
                    <p>Plastics are now one of the most common pollutants of ocean waters worldwide. Pushed 
                        by winds, tides and currents, plastic particles form with other debris into large 
                        swirling glutinous accumulation zones, known to oceanographers as gyres, which 
                        comprise as much as 40 percent of the planet’s ocean surface  — roughly 25 percent.
