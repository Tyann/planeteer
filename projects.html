            <h2>Upcoming Green Project in the World</h2>
            <br>
            <h3>The driblet:"Pico-hydropowered" Water saving device</h3>
            
            <p>
                <img src="image/driblet.png" alt="driblet pico-hydropowered" style="float: left;"/>
                The Driblet, a small, wireless device that attaches itself to 
                the pipe that connects your water supply to your showerhead or
                your facet or hose and measures how much water you use. 
                The Driblet has its own app and syncs to your smartphone so you
                can monitor and even control the amount of water being used 
                wherever it is in place.  You can also monitor the temperature 
                of the water, thereby watching your energy use, too.
            <br>
            <br>
             I can already envision my husband setting up an alarm on his 
                phone and then yelling upstairs to my teenaged son when he’s 
                in the shower: “That’s it! Turn it off !” after he’s used 
                whatever we deem to be an acceptable amount of water for a shower.
            <br>
            <br>    
                The coolest part about the Driblet, to me, is that it doesn’t 
                even use a battery.  The water flowing through it gives it 
                enough power to operate.  A hydro-powered device that helps 
                monitor your water use is pretty cool stuff. The Driblet could be 
                used in conjunction with solar hot water. The company has no plans 
                to integrate The Driblet with solar water heating systems but 
                perhaps that’s a partnership that will happen in the future.

            <h3>Sausage Farm Goes Energy Independent</h3>
            <p>
                <img src="image/sausage farm.jpg" alt="sausage farm" style="float: left; width: 31%;"/>
                The sausage is made with 100 percent renewable energy. 
                ARiES Energy served as the integrator of a biomass-to-energy 
                gasification system that was the first commercial application 
                of a Proton Power Inc (PPI) system in the world.
            <br>
            <br>
                PPI’s renewable energy system produces hydrogen on demand from 
                biomass and waste sources. This technology, referred to as 
                Cellulose to Hydrogen Power (CHyP), is ideal for clean energy 
                applications such as distributed or central-station electrical 
                power generation, hydrogen production or producing synthetic 
                fuels such as renewable gasoline, diesel and aviation fuel, 
                according to Abouelata.
            <br>
            <br>
           
                This project uses locally grown switchgrass as a feedstock 
                to produce power from the hydrogen on-demand system. The PPI 
                system is supplemented by a 530-kW of solar PV array that was 
                installed in two parts, first in 2009 and then 2011.
                Wampler Farms is now net-zero grid-connected; producing clean 
                renewable energy that provides its entire base electrical needs.

            <h3>Victoria Government to Build Wind Plus Storage for Advanced Agriculture Facility</h3>
            <p>
                <img src="image/australia palnt.jpg" alt=" australia storage plant" style="float: left; width:31%;"/>
                The government of Victoria, Australia, recently completed an 
                agreement that supports the development of a wind power plus 
                energy storage facility for a crop farm in Western Victoria.
                The new facility will power the expansion of Stawell, 
                Australia-based Nectar Farms, a “smart farming” company that, 
                according to the company’s website, focuses on environmentally 
                friendly farming with glasshouses, hydroponics and high-wire 
                cultivation.
                <br>
                <br>
                The government said that it signed a 15-year support agreement 
                with clean energy developer Neoen Australia for delivery of the 
                integrated energy project, called Bulgana Green Power Hub.
                According to a statement from the government, the power hub 
                will include a 204-MW wind farm and 20-MW battery. Details 
                about the battery’s MWh energy storage capacity were not provided.
                <br>
                <br>
                “This is an exciting initiative which illustrates how renewable 
                energy can unlock opportunities for large, energy intensive 
                businesses to create jobs and build a better future for regional 
                communities,” Victoria Minister for Energy, Environment and Climate 
                Change Lily D’Ambrosio said.
